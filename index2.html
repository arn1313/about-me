    <p class="one">I have been playing video games since the launch of the Atari 2600. I have pretty much been playing ever since. There have been times in my life when gaming has taken as much time as a part-time job. I have met some of my best friends through gaming, i actually met my future spouse in an MMO called EverQuest2. Because i like to share, here is a list of my favorite games</p>
