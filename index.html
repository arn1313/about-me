    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p class="one">I am officially starting on my path to become a Software Developer but my background is the legal/financial industry. I was born and raised in the great state of Nevada. When i was 21, i packed up everything i owned and moved to San Francisco. I lived there for a few years but decided i needed a change. In 1999 i again packed up and rolled out for Seattle and have never looked back! For the last 5 years i have been working as an Office Manager/Paralegal. It is an intense and high paced work environment and i enjoyed the atomosphere and culture that surrounded it but recently i felt it was time for a change. I decided the change i needed was <b>Code Fellows</b></p>
