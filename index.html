    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p><b>Thanks for visting my page!</b></p>
        <p>I am officially starting on my path to become a Software Developer but my background is the legal/financial industry.</p>
<hr />
    <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in the great state of Nevada. When i was 21 years old, i packed up everything i owned and moved to San Francisco. I lived there for a few years but decided i needed a change. In 1999 i again packed up and rolled out for Seattle and have never looked back!</p>
      <p>For the last 5 years i have been working as an Office Manager/Paralegal. It is an <b>intense</b> and <b>high paced</b> work environment and i enjoyed the atomosphere and culture that surrounded it but recently i felt it was time for a change. I decided the change i needed was <b>Code Fellows</b></p>
